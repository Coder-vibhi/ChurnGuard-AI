## 🧐 About The Project (Project Kya Hai?)

**ChurnGuard AI** is a strategic dashboard designed for the E-Commerce and Telecom sector. In a world where retaining customers is harder than acquiring new ones, this tool uses data intelligence to predict **"Who is leaving?"** and **"Why?"**.

It transforms raw data into actionable insights, helping business managers visualize:
* **🌍 Geographic Hotspots:** Which states are facing the highest churn?
* **📉 Revenue Risk:** How much money is at stake this month?
* **🎯 Risk Segmentation:** Dividing customers into High (🔴), Medium (🟡), and Low (🟢) risk categories for targeted action.
